## Key bindings (shortcuts) for apps.

# NOTE: Use \u200b (zero-width space) to disable a shortcut for a menu item.

# NOTE: For a menu item in the preferences like A->B-C, use "\033A\033B\033C".

# Allow Ctrl+PageDown and Ctrl+PageUp to cycle between tabs, same as Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab.
# FIXME: We'll probably have to use Karabiner to allow 2 sets of bindings for the same function.
