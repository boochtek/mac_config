## Configuration of my Drop (Massdrop) CTRL keyboard.
# NOTE: QMK has a ton of dependencies; Homebrew will take a while to download/compile them.
brew install qmk/qmk/qmk

## Install Massdrop firmware loader
wget https://github.com/Massdrop/mdloader/releases/download/1.0.3/mdloader_mac -O /usr/local/sbin/mdloader
chmod 0555 /usr/local/sbin/mdloader
chgrp admin /usr/local/sbin/mdloader

## Key bindings (shortcuts) for apps.

# NOTE: Use \u200b (zero-width space) to disable a shortcut for a menu item.
# NOTE: We can replace `-g` with the app name (in reverse DNS form) for app-specific bindings.
# NOTE: For a menu item in the preferences like A->B-C, use "\033A\033B\033C".

# Tab cycling (Ctrl+PageDown/PageUp) and CUA clipboard (Shift+Del, Ctrl+Ins,
# Shift+Ins, Ctrl+Del) are deliberately NOT bound here with NSUserKeyEquivalents.
# That mechanism REPLACES a menu item's single shortcut, so it would override
# Command+X/C/V rather than adding the CUA chords as aliases -- and it only binds
# Cocoa menu items. Instead these are key-level remaps in QMK firmware (K1 Pro)
# and Karabiner (internal/other keyboards): the CUA chord sends Command+X/C/V and
# Ctrl+PageDown/Up sends Ctrl+Tab / Ctrl+Shift+Tab, leaving the native Command
# shortcuts intact. See the Karabiner rules "CUA cut and paste (on PC keyboard)"
# and "Control+PageUp/PageDown cycles through tabs", and the K1 Pro QMK PRD (F3-F5).

# TODO: Allow Ctrl+Enter and/or Command+Enter to send emails (Command+Shift+D in Mac Mail).

# TODO: Manually added these (since above didn't work) in Preferences / Keyboard:
#           Ctrl+Tab        Show Next Tab
#           Ctrl+Shift+Tab  Show Previous Tab

# TODO: Manually disabled Ctrl+Up and Ctrl+Down in Preferences / Keyboard / Shortcuts / Mission Control:
#           UNCHECK Mission Control
#           UNCHECK Application windows
# Also disable Ctrl+Left and Ctrl+Right, so we can use them to move by words.
#           UNCHECK Mission Control / Move left a space
#           UNCHECK Mission Control / Move right a space
# This will allow us to use Ctrl+Shift+Up and Ctrl+Shift+Down for Sublime Text multi-line selection.
# NOTE: Ideally, these should all be Command-prefixed, as they're global.

# Pressing and holding a key pops up a menu of alternative related characters.
# NOTE: This doesn't work in terminal apps, but should work for most other text inputs.
