# MSL is how long a packet may live in the network before it's considered lost.
# TIME_WAIT is the time that a connection stays in the TIME_WAIT state after it's closed.
# MSL defaults to 15000 ms. TIME_WAIT is 2×MSL.
# Siege recommends setting MSL to 1 second for load testing. I'm setting it to 2 to be more conservative.
