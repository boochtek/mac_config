# Run this from YOUR Mac's terminal (not inside the VM) AFTER you've enabled
# Remote Login in the VM (System Settings → General → Sharing → Remote Login).
# It prompts for the VM account password a couple of times; the AI never sees
# it. This avoids pasting into the VM window (host↔guest clipboard is flaky).
